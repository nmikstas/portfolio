                <h4 class="indent">Heterodyning Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this webpage is to describe the basic theory of how an ultrasonic probe
                    converts ultrasound into something a human can hear. These probes are used in predictive
                    maintenance with motors, gearboxes and bearings. They can also be used to track down compressed
                    air leaks. This webpage is designed for a very beginner and only touches on very basic math
                    topics. The math involved in spectral analysis and digital signal processing can become very
                    involved and entire graduate programs in electrical engineering are dedicated to the subject.

                    Heterodyning is simply the multiplication of two frequencies to create new frequencies. Often
                    times heterodyning is called mixing. The term mixing may be used throughout this document and
                    is synonymous with heterodyning. The basic concept is that an ultrasonic frequency is mixed
                    with an intermediate frequency (IF) and a new frequency is generated that can be heard by
                    the human ear. All the information contained in the ultrasonic frequencies is retained and
                    shifted to the new frequency. This is the basic concept of how a radio transmitter and
                    receiver work. When transmitting, the audio is mixed with the carrier frequency, often times in
                    the tens or hundreds of megahertz range and transmitted through the air. A receiver then mixes the 
                    incomming transmission with an intermediate frequency and the audio is recovered at a lower frequency.
                    No information is lost during the mixing process and the audio can be heard and understood.

                <p>
                    When dealing with the subject of frequency, signals are usually analysed in two different domains:
                    time domain and frequency domain. Time domain is easy and understood by anyone who has used an
                    oscilloscope or a graphing calculator. The time domain simply refers to a signal that uses time as the
                    x-axis. Below is a time domain signal on an oscilloscope.
